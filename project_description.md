# Project Description
## Clients
A new startup financial institution, Capstone Savings Bank is a web-based bank that offers basic checking and savings accounts.
## Users
	The primary users of the site will be the general public (prospective accountholders), current accountholders, and customer service administrators. 
## Problem/Need
Capstone Savings Bank needs an online presence to attract new customers and provide current customers with a modern and intuitive tool to manage their accounts. The site will also afford customer service administrators a simple and secure way to interact with customer accounts.
## General Functionality
	Upon visiting the site’s home page, all visitors will be presented with the main page which will have sales content promoting the bank and its current promotions. There will be a prominent link to login to the site that accountholders and administrators will follow to securely enter their username and password criteria. Other visitors will be able to follow links to securely register for a new account.
The general public will be able to:
*	View sales and promotional offers available to new customers with descriptions of benefits enjoyed by current customers.
*	Ability to register a new account and fund that account with a debit card
*	The bank’s mission statement and contact and location information
*	Financial tips and tools (calculators, etc.)
*	Legal information and disclaimers

Once logged in, accountholders will have the ability to:
*	View an overview of all their accounts with detailed transaction listings for those account(s)
*	Add funds to their account using a debit card
*	Transfer funds between accounts or open an additional account
*	Download transaction data as .CSV or .XLS file
*	Search transactions within an account or filter and sort by date range

If an administrator enters the proper criteria, they will be prompted to enter their employee passcode. Upon successful entry, they will be presented with an administration dashboard which will allow them to:
*	View and search (by account number or name) from the entire list of accountholders
*	Select a user’s account, view contact and identity information, security question answers, and see their transaction list just as the user does
*	Manually edit certain transactions for the purpose of reversing fees
*	Transfer funds between accounts or change a customer’s user id at the customer’s request
*	Open or close customer accounts and send messages or alerts to customers

Administrators will be able to view nearly all information pertaining to a customer’s profile. They will _not_, however, be able view the customer’s online banking password
